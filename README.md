> **Predicting Cross-Cultural Adaptation Outcomes Using Machine Learning: A Comparative Study of Hong Kong (N = 75) and France (N = 249)**

This repository contains the core training code for the V7 ensemble model used in a cross-cultural psychology study. The V7 model applies stacked gradient boosting (6 base learners + linear meta-learner) with 5-fold cross-validation to predict cross-cultural adaptation scores.

## 🔬 Study Overview

| | Hong Kong | France |
|---|---|---|
| **N** | 75 | 249 |
| **Outcome** | Cross-cultural adaptation score | Cross-cultural adaptation score |
| **Predictors** | 11 psychological/social variables | 11 psychological/social variables |
| **Best model R²** | .847 (5-fold CV mean) | .831 (5-fold CV mean) |
| **Algorithm** | V7 stacked ensemble (6 base learners + LinearRegression meta-learner) | Same |

### V7 Model Architecture

The V7 ensemble uses **stacking** with the following base learners:
- DeepFM (neural network with factorization machines)
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost
- Gradient Boosting (sklearn)
- Random Forest

A **LinearRegression** meta-learner combines the out-of-fold predictions from all 6 base learners. Feature importance is computed as a SHAP-weighted average across the tree-based models.

### Key Variables (11 predictors)

| Abbreviation | English | Chinese |
|---|---|---|
| CC | Cultural Contact | 文化接触 |
| SC | Social Contact | 社会接触 |
| SCn | Social Connectedness | 社会联结感 |
| FS | Family Support | 家庭支持 |
| Op | Openness | 开放性 |
| CM | Cultural Maintenance | 文化保持 |
| MHK | Months in HK/France | 来港/法时长 |
| CF | Communication Frequency | 家庭沟通频率 |
| CH | Communication Honesty | 沟通坦诚度 |
| Au | Autonomy | 自主权 |
| SM | Social Maintenance | 社会保持 |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare data

The training scripts expect real survey data files (not included in this repository due to participant privacy):

- **HK model** (`train_v7_complete_with_cv.py`): requires `CFA/HKN=75.xlsx`
- **France model** (`train_france_v7_complete_with_cv.py`): requires `CFA/Franchn=249.xlsx`

To generate synthetic training data (100k samples) from the real data using a Gaussian Copula + Interaction Regression approach:

```bash
python archive/generate_interaction_preserved_dataset.py
```

This saves the synthetic dataset to `data/processed/interaction_preserved_100k.csv`.

### 3. Train models

```bash
# Hong Kong sample (N=75), 5-fold cross-validation
python train_v7_complete_with_cv.py

# France sample (N=249), 5-fold cross-validation
python train_france_v7_complete_with_cv.py
```

Results are saved to `results/` (HK) and `france_models/` (France).

## 📊 Main Results

### Model Performance (V7, 5-Fold Cross-Validation)

| Metric | Hong Kong | France |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| R² (mean ± SD) | .847 ± .031 | .831 ± .018 |
| RMSE | 0.312 | 0.287 |
| MAE | 0.241 | 0.219 |

### Top Interaction Effects

**Hong Kong:** Cultural Contact × Openness (ΔR² = .029, *p* = .010)

**France:** Family Support × Cultural Maintenance (ΔR² = .021, *p* = .032)
